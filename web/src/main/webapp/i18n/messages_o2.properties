If you do not have a proper mobile data plan, you can be charged for all data use by your mobile phone carrier. While many mobile phones automatically disable data usage when roaming (using your mobile phone outside your country or covered area of your carrier), if the data connection is active and you use the ChartsNow Service while roaming, it can and will result in even higher charges, often regardless of regular unlimited mobile data plans. ChartsNow is in no way responsible or liable, for any and all charges you receive from your mobile phone carrier, by using the ChartsNow Service. We recommend that when using the ChartsNow service, particularly for the first time, you do so using a WiFi internet connection as opposed to your mobile network data connection so as to ensure you avoid mobile network data charges.\u2028<br />     <br />     <strong>2.5</strong><br />     <br />     You are hereby warned that the ChartsNow Service is intended for use with your own mobile phone carrier in the Territory in which you subscribed to the service.

We may also have to alter code or access numbers or technical specifications associated with the ChartsNow Service for operational reasons and, where we need to tell you about this, we will give you as much notice as we can.\u2028<br />     <br />     <strong>4.2</strong><br />     <br />     If we give you instructions about health and safety issues when using the ChartsNow Service, or regarding your use of the ChartsNow Service to ensure the quality of the service that we provide to you and other users, you agree to fully observe those instructions.<br />     <br />     <strong>4.3</strong>\u2028<br />     <br />     You are hereby advised that the ChartsNow Service requires an internet connection regularly.

However, we will try to keep you fully informed of any such changes.<br />     <br />     <strong>4.6</strong>\u2028<br />     <br />     We may monitor messages to or from, and conversations with, the ChartsNow support team for training purposes and to improve our customer service.<br />     <br />     <strong>4.7</strong>\u2028<br />     <br />     If we cannot do something that we have promised to do in these Terms because of circumstances that are beyond our reasonable control (including, without limitation, any industrial dispute(s) involving any or all of our employees), we will not be liable to you for this. If the applicable circumstances continue for a period of more than three (3) consecutive months, we can terminate the legal contract between you and us immediately by giving you written notice pursuant to paragraph 7.1 below.<br />     <br />     <strong>4.8</strong><br />     <br />     These Terms set out the full extent of our obligations and liabilities to you in respect of the deployment and provision of the ChartsNow Service to you.
