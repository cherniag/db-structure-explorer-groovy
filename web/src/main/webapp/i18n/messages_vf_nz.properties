ChartsNow is in no way responsible or liable, for any and all charges you receive from your mobile phone carrier, by using the ChartsNow Service. We recommend that when using the ChartsNow service, particularly for the first time, you do so using a WiFi internet connection as opposed to your mobile network data connection so as to ensure you avoid mobile network data charges.\u2028<br />     <br />     <strong>2.5</strong><br />     <br />     You are hereby warned that the ChartsNow Service is intended for use with your own mobile phone carrier in the Territory in which you subscribed to the service.
