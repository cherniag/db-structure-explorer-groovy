</p>

		
		<p class="firstHeader">2.1. Isn&#39;t this like other music services out there? </p>
		<p class="firstPar">No, Vodafone Music is different. Vodafone Music:<br><br>

		<p class="firstHeader"><a name="3">3. How does the Vodafone Music App work?</a><br/><hr></p>
		
		<p class="firstHeader">3.1. How do I get the music on my phone?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Vodafone Music updates overnight so you just need to tap update each morning to get the latest music, bonus tracks and celeb news. We recommend you use wifi to download the app and get your updates in order to avoid charges. Downloading the charts over mobile data may take a while and you could see charges on your phone bill.</p>
				
		<p class="firstHeader">3.2. HOW DO I GET VIDEO ON MY PHONE?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Video is only available to Vodafone customers with 4G. If you&#39;ve just purchased your phone there can be a 24 hour delay before our video service is available but you will still be able to listen to the playlists. Unfortunately this service is unavailable to 4G Business consumers. </p>
		
		<p class="firstHeader">3.3. HOW DO I CHANGE MY DOWNLOAD SETTINGS?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Updates can be managed on the &#39;Settings screen&#39; which you&#39;ll find in the main menu. You can choose to download when you are connected to 3G or wifi. We recommend leaving the settings as they are to avoid data charges. Simply tap &#39;update&#39; when prompted, normally once per day.</p>
		
		<p class="firstHeader">3.4. DO I KEEP ALL OF THE SONGS IN Vodafone Music FOREVER?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">You&#39;ll have full and unlimited access to the songs in the Official Top 40 playlist for as long as they&#39;re in the Official Top 40 chart. We update the Just In and Vodafone Playlists several times a week. You can listen to any track in those playlists for as long as they are featured. When you subscribe you can pin your favourites which allows you to keep the tracks you want on your mobile. You can pin a maximum of 10 tracks. If you want to own any of the songs in a current Vodafone Music playlist, tap on the Buy link to download it from iTunes or 7digital.</p>
		
		<p class="firstHeader">3.5. HOW OFTEN IS MUSIC UPDATED?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">The Official Top 40 is updated every Monday. The Just In playlist updates daily so you never miss a new release. Other playlists update several times a week. You&#39;ll have new music and content waiting for you whenever you update. For Vodafone customers with 4G, music videos are refreshed daily.</p>

		<p class="firstHeader">3.6. CAN I USE MY PHONE WHILE THE Vodafone Music APP IS DOWNLOADING MY MUSIC?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Of course you can. You can leave the app at any time while the chart is updating and continue to use your phone. When you return to the app, the chart should be loaded. As soon as the first track is downloaded you&#39;ll have the rest of the music available to you in seconds. </p>
		
		<p class="firstHeader">3.7. CAN I TAKE A CALL WHEN I&#39;M LISTENING TO THE CHART?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Yes, the Vodafone Music App will pause to let you answer an incoming call and will resume when you end your call.</p>
		
		<p class="firstHeader">3.8. CAN I USE MY PHONE WHEN WATCHING VIDEO? </p>
		<p class="firstPar">Music videos will pause when you exit the screen. If you want to text or call you can go back to watching videos as soon as you&#39;re finished. </p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.9. CAN I SEND AND RECEIVE TEXTS WHILE LISTENING TO THE APP?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Of course, you can listen to the Official Top 40 chart while you text your friends and let them know what you&#39;re listening to.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.10. DO MY TRACKS DOWNLOAD IN ORDER?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Yes, your Official Top 40 chart will download first, followed by your Just In and Your Playlist. As soon as the first track has been downloaded you can play it straight away.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.11. HOW MUCH DATA WILL Vodafone Music USE?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">We recommend that you use wifi to download the app and get your updates. Downloading the charts over mobile data may take a while and you could see charges on your phone bill. If you choose to download the app and songs over mobile data, the first download will be about 100mb. Updates after that will vary depending on how many songs are updated. All videos are streamed and we recommend using wifi to avoid data charges.<br><br>

Videos are streamed not downloaded so unless you&#39;re using wifi you will use data from your allowance. A music video can vary in size but on average will use around 25MB of data when streaming.
</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.12. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DOWNLOAD THE CHART?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">On average, it will take a few minutes to download all of the music on your Vodafone Music App when on wifi. If you&#39;re using 3G then it may take a little longer and there may be data charges.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.13. WHEN I TRY TO PLAY A TRACK, I GET A MESSAGE SAYING THAT THE TRACK HAS NOT YET BEEN DOWNLOADED. WHY IS THIS?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">If the track has not downloaded then either the track is still queued for download or there was a problem with your connection while your chart was updating. The Vodafone Music App can handle this so please select &#39;Music Update&#39; from the message prompt on your Vodafone Music home screen.</p>

			<p class="firstHeader">3.14. I HAVE A 4G TARIFF WHY CAN&#39;T I PLAY ANY VIDEOS?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">We&#39;ve not yet been able to verify your 4G tariff. This can take up to 24 hours. Messaging within the app will notify you when you can access the videos. Keep checking on the video section for updates.</p>

		<p class="firstHeader">3.15. WILL THERE BE ANY MESSAGES OR ADS ON THE VIDEO SITE BEFORE IT STREAMS?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">No. There are no messages or advertisements. You&#39;ll be taken directly to the music video you want to watch. </p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.16. WHAT DOES Vodafone Music COST?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">At the end of your free trial 02 Tracks will cost you &#163;1 per week if you&#39;re with Vodafone and &#163;4.99 a month if you&#39;re on another network. If you are an Vodafone 4G customer you can get full access to Vodafone Music as well as the latest music videos and exclusive backstage content for &#163;1.50 per week with Vodafone Music Video. We offer multiple week payment options to suit you.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.17. HOW WILL I BE CHARGED?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Vodafone customers will be charged on their mobile bill. Customers not on an Vodafone mobile contract will be charged via app store billing. Vodafone Business consumers are charged either on their credit card or Paypal.</p>	

<p class="firstHeader">3.18. I&#39;VE BEEN PAYING FOR Vodafone Music BUT HAVE UPGRADED TO 4G FOR THE FREE VIDEO SERVICE. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY I&#39;VE PAID?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">You will receive a credit for any full weeks outstanding. The credit will appear on your next mobile bill.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.19. HOW DO I CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION TO Vodafone Music?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">You can unsubscribe within the app or by using your app store account, such as iTunes. All recurring payments will be cancelled. However, you&#39;ll still have access to Vodafone Music for the weeks you have paid for. </p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.20. CAN I UNSUBSCRIBE AT ANY TIME AND HOW DO I DO THIS?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Yes you can do this within the app in the My Account section or your app store account, such as iTunes.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.21. I AM IN THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD BUT CANNOT ACCESS THE VIP AREA?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Even though you are in the your free trial period you will lose access to the VIP section if you choose to unsubscribe during the trial. You still have access to all the other great features in Vodafone Music.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.22. CAN I USE Vodafone Music ON MORE THAN ONE PHONE?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Vodafone Music works on just one phone at a time. If you use your mobile number to activate the app on another phone, the phone you used previously will no longer update.</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.23. WILL Vodafone Music WORK ON MY TABLET?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Our Vodafone Music app for tablets is coming soon. In the meantime you can use Vodafone Music on iPads and some Android tablets but the app will not scale to full screen.<br><br>

If you do want to use Vodafone Music on your tablet you will need to enter a mobile number to activate the app. Remember, Vodafone Music works on just one device at a time, so if you use your mobile phone number to also activate the app on your tablet, any phone you used previously will no longer update. Of course, if you have another number for your tablet, you can activate a separate Vodafone Music account using this number. <br><br>

Vodafone Music on your tablet will cost the same as it does on your mobile so if you use an Vodafone mobile number you&#39;ll get an 8 week free access and then pay &#163;1 a week. If you are not an Vodafone mobile contract you&#39;ll get 2 weeks free and then pay &#163;4.99 a month. 
</p>

<p class="firstHeader">3.24. I AM A TESCO MOBILE OR GIFFGAFF CUSTOMER HOW LONG WILL I GET MY FREE Vodafone Music ACCESS FOR?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Tesco Mobile and giffgaff use Vodafone&#39;s network, however you&#39;re not a direct Vodafone customer. As a Tesco Mobile or giffgaff customer you&#39;re eligible for a free 2 week access on Vodafone Music.<br><br>

					<!--Section 4-->

		<p class="firstHeader"><a name="6">4. What about my operator and data charges? </a><br/><hr></p>

		<p class="firstHeader">4.1.  How does the service affect my data charges?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">If you choose to update the charts over mobile data, you may see charges on your phone bill, but you can use wifi instead.  Video is a streaming service and will incur data charges if you stream over 4G. There will be no charge if you use Wifi.</p>

		<p class="firstHeader">4.2.  Does the Vodafone Music App actively help me avoid data charges?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Yes, Vodafone Music will try to download over your wifi connection, wherever there is a connection available.<br><br>

The app will tell you if it can&#39;t find a wifi connection and ask you if you&#39;d like to download over mobile data. Using mobile data may cost more so we recommend that you use wifi when updating the charts.<br><br>

You&#39;ll need to contact your mobile network provider to confirm what data charges will apply to you. If you&#39;re an Vodafone customer please visit <a href="#">#</a> for contact information.</p>

		<p class="firstHeader">4.3. CAN I USE Vodafone Music WHILE TRAVELLING ABROAD?</p>
		<p class="firstPar">Yes, provided you download Vodafone Music and register your account in the UK before you travel.<br><br>

To avoid higher than normal data charges, we recommend you set Vodafone Music to update over wifi while you are travelling abroad. If you have data roaming turned on while abroad, music downloads and daily updates to Vodafone Music over 3G will incur higher than normal data charges. We would recommend you don&#39;t use the video service abroad unless you have a wifi connection. <br><br>
