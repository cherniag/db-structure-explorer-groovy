We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time which will be updated and shown on <a href="http://www.vodafone.co.nz/vodafonemusic">www.vodafone.co.nz/vodafonemusic</a>. Your continued use of the App will be deemed to constitute acceptance of the Terms (as varied from time to time).</p><p>Vodafone is the promoter of Vodafone Music.  &ldquo;You&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Your&rdquo; refers to You, the customer and user of the App. MusicQubed creates packaged, low cost music delivered straight to a mobile Device.   \u201CMobile device\u201D means portable devices with restricted screen size which are able to access the MQ service via an over-the-air cellular network data connection, but also permitting access via Wi-Fi. \u201CSubscription service\u201D means a subscription service offering customers within the Territory on-demand and advertising free access to the playback of all or a part of full length versions of audio recordings which at the time of access form part of a chart compiled by MQ, accessed via the MusicQubed software application, in return for a periodic subscription fee. \u201CTerritory\u201D means New Zealand.</p><p>You will need to have access to a suitable mobile device and access or a subscription to a service, including data services, in order to access and use the App. Not all mobile devices are supported and you agree that neither Vodafone nor MusicQubed has any obligation to support any particular make or model of mobile device, whether or not such make or model is currently, or was previously supported.</p><p>To use the App You must be (a) eighteen (18) years old or older, or be thirteen (13) years or older and Your parent or legal guardian consents to and agrees to be bound by these Terms; (b) have power to enter these Terms (that is, not be legally barred from doing so for any reason); and (c) be a local resident in the Territory. In consideration of you agreeing to the Terms you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the App on mobile devices subject to these Terms solely in the Territory.  You are not permitted to use the App outside the Territory.  We reserve all other rights.</p><p>You must not use the App or any of the content accessed via the App in any unlawful manner or for any unlawful purpose.</p><p>These Terms set out the full extent of Vodafone\u2019s and MusicQubed\u2019s obligations and liabilities in respect of the supply of the App. Except as expressly stated in these Terms, any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the supply of the App which might otherwise be implied into, or incorporated in, these Terms, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p><p>To start using Vodafone Music you must provide your current mobile phone number. You agree to provide true, current and complete information about yourself when prompted and to promptly update the information that you provide from time to time to keep information true, current and complete. If We have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information that you have provided is in fact untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, your access to the App may be suspended or terminated.</p><p>When signing up to use the App for the first time, you will be entitled to a trial period during which you will be able to enjoy all of the functionality and benefits provided by the app without having to make any payment (other than to purchase permanent downloads of audio recordings or video recordings, and mobile data charges where applicable). Any unused portion of the free trial will not be forfeited if you sign up to the Subscription Service during the free trial period.</p><p>If you are a Vodafone mobile customer you will receive the Subscription service free of charge for 4 weeks from the date you begin the trial. At the end of this period Vodafone Consumer mobile customers will have the option to subscribe to the service at a price of $1.50 a week or $6 per 4 weeks payable via Premium SMS (details of that payment will be available in the My Account screen within the app), or on your bill.
